# Weather Project - Python Final
Freshmen Edge: Intro to Programming Course Final Project by: Khaled, Diala, Maya, and Belal

## Project Goal:</h2>

Our project aims to combine user input usage of OpenWeather's API to retrieve weather data that the user is interested in.
The user enters the name of a city and the code searches for it, then connects to the API's current-weather service, retrieving multiple articles of data related to the weather at the given location.

##Final check up I promise...
